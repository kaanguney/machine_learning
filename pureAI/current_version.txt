The test at the last cell on CurrentVersion.ipynb does the following:

  -> uses 3 hidden layers of sizes 10,10,5 respectively
  -> epoch = 1, fixed
  -> uses mini-batch SGD of mini-batch_size = 5
  -> accepts convergence if the difference between current loss(error) and previous loss is below 0.0001
  -> performs itself 100 times and takes the average for total delay & iteration calculation

What it does not do:

  -> does not satisfy non-i.i.d set requirements
  -> no plots of any kind (accuracy&epoch,loss&epoch,delay&update)
  -> epoch number is not mutable, it's fixed to 1 for faster performance
  -> does not try different stopping conditions other than 0.0001
